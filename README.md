## Description

I created a mobile first application called Mr. Blue Sky. This application will help users begin to understand why they feel the way that they do and how external factors impact their mood. 

Mr. Blue Sky can be used as a basic journaling application, however what sets it apart is that it allows the user to view correlation between mood and weather.
